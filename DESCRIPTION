Description: It computes arbitrary products moments (mean vector and variance-covariance matrix), for some double truncated (and folded) multivariate distributions. These distributions belong to the family of selection elliptical distributions, which includes well known skewed distributions as the unified skew-t distribution (SUT) and its particular cases as the extended skew-t (EST), skew-t (ST) and the symmetric student-t (T) distribution. Analogous normal cases unified skew-normal (SUN), extended skew-normal (ESN), skew-normal (SN), and symmetric normal (N) are also included. Density, probabilities and random deviates are also offered for these members.
